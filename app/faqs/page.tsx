                Client assets are held with regulated third-party custodians in

              </h2>
              <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
                Our pricing is a transparent, all-in advisory fee based on assets
                under management. There are no trading commissions or hidden
                platform charges. You see the impact of fees on every performance
                report, and your advisor will review the structure with you
                before you fund your account.

              <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
                Yes. You can request withdrawals at any time, subject to standard
                settlement periods for the underlying securities. Your advisor
                will help you plan liquidity so that withdrawal requests align
                with your portfolio strategy and tax considerations.

                Yes. We can incorporate environmental, social, and governance
                preferences directly into your portfolio design, including
                exclusions, tilts, and thematic allocations. We work with you to
                balance those preferences with diversification and risk
                management.

                Our standard minimum is $5,000, though institutional or bespoke
                mandates may require higher balances. Regardless of starting size,
                every client receives the same disciplined process and transparent

                At minimum, we conduct a formal review at least annually, with
                additional check-ins during major life events or market changes.

                messages through the portal whenever questions arise.
